        More Random Relationships!

        Bored of just having familial relationships? These add a few alternatives.

        Works with Edb Prepare Carefully.

        This is essentially just an XML mod. If you add your own, you will need to make a copy and make it an internal mod to prevent updates from overwriting your changes.
